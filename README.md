# AIsimple
The simplest AI for Arduino to understand how AI works at the lowest level

  it is the simplest AI(kind of we can call it as).
  This program run on almost any MCU supports Arduino.
  What the program will do is SIMPLY you give inputs and outputs and it will tell which program will be well suited to take these inputs and output the desired result.
  
  This thing now can report whether we can do:
  
      addition
      subraction
      multiplication
      division
      power
  It is not that type of AI what we see today but it is foremost the simplest AI ever to b found cause the main difference between the AI and the conventional programming is what we get as the output. In conventional programming, the result will be the output, as per the inputs and the program that the programmer told to to. i.e inputs+program=output/s
  
  But in AI that is not like that, the ouput will be the program instead of the output, the inputs are the input and results itself. here our code also does the same thing. telling which program to do(i.e which operation).
